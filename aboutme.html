<p>When I was young I used to help my grandparents in the farm to harvest goods and sell them in the market.During those days my Mom was working abroad to give me a better quality of life, she gave me my allowance every week, but I didn't want it because I knew how expensive the tax was there, So I manage to make my own money by helping my grandparents.</p>
